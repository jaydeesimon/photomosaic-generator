Trying to see if I can create a photo mosaic generator. From Wikipedia: "a photographic mosaic, also known under the term Photomosaic, a portmanteau of photo and mosaic, is a picture (usually a photograph) that has been divided into (usually equal sized) tiled sections, each of which is replaced with another photograph that matches the target photo." A well-known example of this is the Truman show poster.

Below is what I got so far. This is only using one photo superimposed on a picture of flowers. I matched the picture of the tiny photo by grayscaling it and then turning it into the shade of the color that I needed.
